# Project 2

Third project in IN1910 about custom data structures in C++.

Repo url : https://github.uio.no/IN1910/H22_project2_vegardfa

I have not answered part 3.


## Compilation

... is covered by the makefile.

Run
```
make test
```
to compile and run the tests for all parts.

Run
```
make execute
```
to compile and run the code for part 4 of the project.

These commands are verified to work on IFI machines.


## Implementation details

I have used separate header files for all source files, but not the test files.
Object files are stored in the `obj` directory, and compiled binary files
in the `bin` directory.
