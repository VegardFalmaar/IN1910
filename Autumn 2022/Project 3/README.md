# Project 3

Fourth project in IN1910.

Repo url : https://github.uio.no/IN1910/H22_project3_vegardfa

Due to shortness of time, I have not done task 1f or part 4 of the project.


# Implementation

For part 1 I have to chosen to use a 2-dimensional numpy array to store the positions of
the corners of the triangle instead of a list of numpy arrays.



# How to run the code

All tests can be run using pytest with
```
make test
```
